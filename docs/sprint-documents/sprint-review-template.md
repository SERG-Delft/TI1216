## Issues not completed

__#32__: Increase coverage to 80%  
This issue was not done because we decided that #14 had priority over this and after finishing it, there was not enough time left to complete it.
To make sure that this won't happen again, we will more carefully check if the workload is achievable

## General Issues

### Issues are too large
Created issues are too large. This means reviewing them takes more time than expected and the issue is more likely not to be completed in the sprint. For the next sprints we will split these up.

## Review of previous sprint reviews

### Better communication

Last week we noticed that the communication in the team via our communication method had declined, which resulted in longer response-times to messages. We added a penalty for not responding quickly enough (bringing candy) and this has resulted in very quick responses. We all agree that this issue has been resolved.
